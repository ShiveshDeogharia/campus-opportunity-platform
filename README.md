# My Project
# Campus Opportunity & Internship Management Platform

A campus-first web platform to centralize on-campus internship and placement opportunities, replacing ad-hoc WhatsApp sharing and Google Forms with a structured, auditable workflow — while retaining Google Sheets as the institutional source of truth.

## Status
Architecture & system design phase.

## Documentation
See `/docs` for detailed system design, data models, API contracts, and export pipeline.

## Scope
- Campus-first MVP
- No internal shortlisting
- Google Sheets as final export layer
- AI used only as assistive tooling
