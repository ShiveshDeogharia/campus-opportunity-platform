# 🚀 NITA Placement Management System

A full-stack placement automation platform for **NIT Agartala** that manages the complete on‑campus recruitment lifecycle — from eligibility filtering to multi‑round selections, analytics, and Google‑powered workflows.

Built as a **hackathon‑grade + production‑grade** system.

---

## 🧠 Why this exists
Placement cells struggle with:
- Manual eligibility filtering  
- CV collection chaos  
- Round‑wise tracking  
- Poor communication  
- Zero analytics  

This system replaces all of that with a **secure, role‑based, real‑time web platform**.

## 🌐 Google‑Powered Hackathon Features

These features were added as **prototype demos** to showcase how Google tools can transform placement workflows.

> ⚠️ These are proof‑of‑concept features — designed to show **vision & capability**, not mass deployment.

### 📧 1. Email Notifications (Gmail API)

- Students selected for next round  
- Students rejected  

Uses **Google Gmail API** for:
